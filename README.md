# Welcome to [Osscie](https://www.google.com) ("oh-see")

This is the Open-Source Social Continuous-Integration Experiment. Our goal is to make the perfect social website, a product of community driven development and democratic choices. Our website runs the code shown here, and anyone can modify it. Here's how it works:

* Any user can make changes, improvements, or additions to our code (pull-requests).
* The community discusses and votes on any changes proposed.
* If people vote in favor of a change, it is automatically pushed into the head, and the website is updated.

## How to get involved

*2. Link your github  account
*3. Checkout the latest version of the head.
